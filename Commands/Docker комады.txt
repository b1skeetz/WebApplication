To deploy an index.html file on a Docker container using VS Code on CentOS, you can follow these steps:
Install Docker on CentOS: You can follow the official Docker documentation to install Docker on CentOS.
Create a Dockerfile: Create a file named Dockerfile in the directory where your index.html file is located. The Dockerfile should contain the following lines:


------Dockerfile------
FROM nginx:latest
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html


This Dockerfile uses the latest version of the official Nginx image as the base image and copies your index.html file to the /usr/share/nginx/html/ directory in the container.
Build the Docker image: Open the VS Code terminal and navigate to the directory where your Dockerfile is located. Run the following command to build the Docker image:


------VS Code Terminal (Ctrl +)------
docker build -t my-image .


This command builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it with the name my-image.
Run the Docker container: After the Docker image has been built, you can run the container using the following command:


------VS Code Terminal (Ctrl +)------
docker run -d --name my-container -p 80:80 my-image


This command runs the container in the background with the name my-container, maps port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container, and uses the my-image Docker image you just built.
Verify the deployment: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost. You should see your index.html file displayed in the browser.
That's it! Your index.html file is now deployed on a Docker container using VS Code on CentOS.
